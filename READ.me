Details on HW 

PyBank and PyPoll have an analysis and resources folder which the python script will iterate through the csv in the resources folder, then output the HW question results to the analysis folder in a separate .csv.

I utilzied GitHub documentation, python documentation, RealPython.com for function/functionality help and AI for design layout assitance.
