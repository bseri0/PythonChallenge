Details on HW 

PyBank and PyPoll have an analysis and resources folder which the python script will iterate through the csv in the resources folder, then output the HW question results to the analysis folder in a separate .csv. The "main.py" python files in each PyBank and PyPoll folder directory contains the HW code. The jupyter notebook file can be ignored.

I utilzied GitHub documentation, python documentation, RealPython.com for function/functionality help and AI for design layout assitance.
